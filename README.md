Interpreting user needs and implementing them into the program can be done by using user stories. Creating user stories helps the development team imagmine all the possible user interactions. The user stories also show the different branches from descisions made in the program. This allows for the flow of the program to have a visual representation which can be explained to anyone that is apart of the development. 
Approaching the development of programs should first recognize a problem that can be solved with an application. After stating the problem the process must be planned to assembeled. The scrum agile process would aide in the development since the plan doesn't need to be solidified in the beginning just major checkpoints need to be laid out. 
A good team member holds themselves and other on the team to the standards in the industry and the team standards to produce the most efficient and effective application possible. Being able to structure criticism in a constructive manner and hold themselves accountable when errors occur also make for a good team member.
